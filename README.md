# Unlimited-Tic-Tac-Toe-Python

Unlimited Tic-Tac-Toe is a grown-up version of the classic 3x3 game, played by two players on an infinite two-dimensional board. Players take turns and place their markers, one in each turn, on free squares, trying to occupy 5 consecutive squares in a row (vertical, horizontal or diagonal). Player with the cross marker starts the game.

## How to start

Use your shell (e.g. PowerShell or CMD in Windows) from the project root directory.

Start your game against the AI player:

`python pyskvorky`

Or, if you want to make the first move:

`python pyskvorky -r`

If you want to watch two AI players play, try:

`python pyskvorky -o rob`

For further instructions check:

`python pyskvorky -h`

With just a few code adjustments you'll get a more complex version aiming at placing 6 consecutive markers. Try for yourself.

Here's an example of such a game:
