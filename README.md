# Unlimited-Tic-Tac-Toe-Python

Unlimited Tic-Tac-Toe is a grown-up version of the classic 3x3 game, played by two players on an infinite two-dimensional board. Players try to place 5 consecutive markers in a row (vertical, horizontal or diagonal). The game starts by placing an X marker on any square, usually (0, 0), the 'center' of the infinite board.
