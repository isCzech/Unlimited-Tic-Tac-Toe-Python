# Unlimited-Tic-Tac-Toe-Python

Unlimited Tic-Tac-Toe is a grown-up version of the classic game played by two players on an infinite two-dimensional board. Players try to place 5 consecutive markers in a row (vertical, horizontal or diagonal). The game starts by placing a marker X on the square (0, 0) (the "center" of the infinite board).

Try to beat the bot and let me know if you succeed; I haven't yet ;)
