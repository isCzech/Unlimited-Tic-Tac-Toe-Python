# Unlimited-Tic-Tac-Toe-Python

Unlimited Tic-Tac-Toe is a grown-up version of the classic 3x3 game, played by two players on an infinite two-dimensional board. Players try to place 5 consecutive markers in a row (vertical, horizontal or diagonal). The game starts by placing an X marker on any square, usually (0, 0), the 'center' of the infinite board.

Start your game against the bot from the cli (PowerShell in Windows) by:

`python pyskvorky`

Or, if you want to make the first move:

`python pyskvorky -r`

For instructions check:

`python pyskvorky -h`

It is, however, possible to try even more difficult version aiming at placing 6 consecutive markers. Here's an example of such a game:
